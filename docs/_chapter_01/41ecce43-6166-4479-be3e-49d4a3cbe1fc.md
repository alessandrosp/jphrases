  - meaning: I'm Kenji.

    tokens:
      - kanji: 私
        kana: わたし
        romaji: watashi
        meaning: I
        note: >
          Equivalent to the first-person singular pronoun [I].  Note that in Japanese the subject is often omitted when it's clear from the contenxt. So the phrase [Kenji desu] would have been equally correct.
      - kanji: は
        kana: は
        romaji: wa
        meaning: N/A
        note: >
          The particle は (pronounced [wa]) marks the topic of the sentence. In Japanese, two distinct particle are used to mark the topic and the subject of a sentence, respectively は and が. For the time being, you shouldn't be concerned over these differences as you can simply think of the word(s) preceding は as the subject of the phrase.
