    <h2>What's this all about?</h2>
    <p>JPhrases is a gamified tool to improve your Japanese by practicing with phrases rather than individual kanji or words. It's rather simple: try to translate each phrase in your head, when you're ready click on <code>Show the r(e)sults.</code> and get the correct answer plus additional information about the various elements in the sentence.</p>
