name: I am, you are...
summary: >
  In this unit you'll study predicative nominal and predicate adjectives, i.e. phrases where the subject is connected to a noun or an adjective via the verb to be. These are phrases such as [Edward is an Englishman] or [I'm tall].
phrases:
  - text: 私はアンナです。
    translation: I'm Anna.
    notes:
    tokens:
      - kanji: 私
        kana: わたし
        romaji: watashi
        meaning: I
        notes: >
          Equivalent to the first-person singular pronoun [I].  Note that in Japanese the subject is often omitted when it's clear from the contenxt. So the phrase [Anna desu] would have been equally correct.
      - kanji: は
        kana: は
        romaji: wa
        meaning: N/A
        notes: >
          The particle は (pronounced [wa]) marks the topic of the sentence. In Japanese, two distinct particles are used to mark the topic and the subject of a sentence, respectively は and が. For the time being, you shouldn't be concerned over these.
      - kanji: アンナ
        kana: アンナ
        romaji: anna
        meaning: Anna (name)
        notes: >
          Non-Japanese names are normally written in katanata. Note that Japanese names, instead, can be written in multiple ways using kanji; for example, [健司], [健治] and [健二] are all different writings for Kenji.
      - kanji: です
        kana: です
        romaji: desu
        meaning: to be
        notes: >
          Verbs don't really conjugate in Japanese, so です could be [am] as well as [are] or [is]. Also, because Japanese doesn't differentiate between present and future, it could also be [will]. As per usual, context can help us decide among all these alternatives.
  - text: アンナさんは学生です。
    translation: Anna is a student.
    notes:
    tokens:
      - kanji: アンナさん
        kana: アンナさん
        romaji: anna-san
        meaning: Anna (name)
        notes: >
          Note how when we talk about someone else we always postpone a honorific to that person's name (here it's さん).
      - kanji: は
        kana: は
        romaji: wa
        meaning: N/A
        notes: >
          The particle は (pronounced [wa]) marks the topic/subject of the sentence.
      - kanji: 学生
        kana: がくせい
        romaji: gakusē
        meaning: student
        notes: >
          Note that [-ei] is read [-ee] in Japanese and that [ku] is read [k]. You can find [学生] written as [gakusei] in romaji, but don't be mistaken: it should be pronounced [gaksee].
      - kanji: です
        kana: です
        romaji: desu
        meaning: to be
        notes: >
          It's fairly common is Japanese to refer to the person you're talking to using the name (instead of the pronoun [you]). So without additional context we can't know whether the sentence here should be translated as [Anna is a student] or [you are a student].
